# multi-svg-and-gif-viewer

## BACKGROUND

Due to windows is not able to preview svg and gif by default, so if we have many svgs and gifs in folder, it's hard to find which one we want.
So I develop this plugin to preview many svgs and gifs at one time in chrome.
Addition, we also support more pic mine, and it can load pictures folder in folder.

## INSTALL

```shell
npm i 
npm run build:development
```

## INTRODUCTION

You can drag or load svgs in chrome by this plugin
Load unpacked plugin(plugin folder) in chrome and then enjoy it!
When you build for single page, you should make debug true in index.tsx
